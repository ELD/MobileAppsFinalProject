For this release, we cleaned up some of the UI and improved the functionality
of the app. The network component is complete and it can now use the user's
location to retrieve a list of theaters. You can also change the fallback
zip code and expand the search radius for movie theaters.

Usage Instructions:
Launch the app and wait for the theater listing to load. From there, select
a theater from the list. Once on the next page, select "now" or the future
date for the movie(s) you want to watch. Select a movie title and a movie
genre from the two pickers and hit "Get Movie Times" button. Some movies
may or may not appear in the correct genre for various reasons. This is
typically due to an API issue. We couldn't normalize the data in such a
way that accounted for such issues, unfortunately.
